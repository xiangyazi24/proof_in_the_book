# Chapter 11: The slope problem

From "Proofs from THE BOOK":

**The slope problem (Ungar's theorem)**: Given n points in the plane,
not all on a line, the number of distinct slopes determined by
connecting pairs of points is at least n - 1.

The book's proof uses an elegant inductive argument combined with
a "rotating calipers" technique: consider the convex hull and analyze
how slopes change as we rotate a direction vector.

This is closely related to the Sylvester-Gallai theorem (Chapter 10).
