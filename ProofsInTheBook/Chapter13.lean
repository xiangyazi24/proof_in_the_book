# Chapter 13: Cauchy's rigidity theorem

From "Proofs from THE BOOK":

**Cauchy's rigidity theorem**: If two convex polyhedra have the same
combinatorial structure and corresponding faces are congruent, then
the polyhedra are congruent (equal up to isometry).

The book's proof uses Cauchy's arm lemma: if we increase some angles
in a convex polygon while keeping side lengths fixed, the polygon
"opens up" (the distance between the first and last vertex increases).

The proof proceeds by:
1. Label each edge + or - according to whether the dihedral angle
   increases or decreases.
2. Use Euler's formula to count sign changes around faces.
3. Apply the arm lemma to derive a contradiction if any signs are non-zero.

edges by whether their dihedral angle increases, decreases, or stays fixed,
then counts sign changes around faces.
